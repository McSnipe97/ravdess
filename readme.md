## Welcome to RAVDESS Emotional Speech Recognition Project
---
In this project, we explored, processed and trained a baseline CNN1D model for the RAVDESS dataset from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/uwrfkaggler/ravdess-emotional-speech-audio

The accuracy from the baseline model is ~45%, which is not to shabby considering the model is classifying both the gender and the emotion.

Metrics for this project are as follows:
